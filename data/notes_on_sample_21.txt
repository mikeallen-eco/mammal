Hi Alex, 

Thanks for letting us know. Bobby, was this the one you caught a little while back, or a separate one?

    Good morning Anthony and Bobby,

    I finished inputting the Exon bat into the google sheets and noticed that I labeled two samples as R19, S19. They are on different days though and wanted to send this out so that I can bring attention to it. 

    The first set of S19,R19 was taken on 8/14 - 8/16 for Red Bat #5.
    The second set of S19, R19 was taken on 9/13 - 9/15 for MYSE #1.
